Problem-1
Write a program that asks for an angle in degrees and converts it to radians. Display the value in radians left justified, in fixed point notation, with 4 places of precision, in a field 5 spaces wide, making sure the decimal point is always displayed. [40 points]

Problem-2
The monthly payment on a loan may be calculated by the following formula:
Payment=  〖Rate*(1+Rate)〗^N/(〖((1+Rate)〗^N-1))*L
Rate is the monthly interest rate, which is the annual interest rate divided by 12. (12% annual interest would be 1 percent monthly interest.) N is the number of payments and L is the amount of the loan. Write a program that asks for these values and displays a report similar to the following: [40 points]

Loan Amount:                 $ 10000.00 
Monthly Interest Rate:                 1% 
Number of Payments:                   36 
=============================
Monthly Payment:         $       332.14
