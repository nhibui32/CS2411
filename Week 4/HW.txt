Problem Statement:

A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue
earned from ticket sales. The remainder goes to the movie distributor. Write a
program that calculates a theater’s gross [20 points], net box ofﬁce proﬁt [15
points], and amount paid to the distributor [10 points] for a night. The program
should ask for the name of the movie [5 points] and how many adult [5 points]
and child [5 points] tickets were sold. Assume that an adult ticket costs $10.00
and a child’s ticket is $5.00. Assume the theater keeps 20 percent of the gross box
ofﬁce proﬁt.

Input Validation: Make sure all the numbers inputted by the user are non-
negative. [10 points]


Programming Style: Make sure the programming style is followed. [10 points]
Programming Comments: Please make sure the code is well-commented. [10 points]
